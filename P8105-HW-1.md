## Problem 1

### Set up dataframe

``` r
set.seed(1)
data_frame = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("single", "married", "divorced", "married", "divorced", "single", "single", "divorced", "married", "single"))
)
data_frame
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1      -0.626 FALSE       a        single    
    ##  2       0.184 TRUE        b        married   
    ##  3      -0.836 FALSE       c        divorced  
    ##  4       1.60  TRUE        d        married   
    ##  5       0.330 TRUE        e        divorced  
    ##  6      -0.820 FALSE       f        single    
    ##  7       0.487 TRUE        g        single    
    ##  8       0.738 TRUE        h        divorced  
    ##  9       0.576 TRUE        i        married   
    ## 10      -0.305 FALSE       j        single

### Mean of each variable in dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(data_frame, 1)) #mean of numeric vector
```

    ## [1] 0.1322028

``` r
mean(pull(data_frame, 2)) #mean of logical vector
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(data_frame, 3)) #mean of character vector
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(data_frame, 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(data_frame, 4)) #mean of factor vector
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(data_frame, 4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean function worked on the numeric and logical vectors. It didn’t
work of the character and factor vectors as NA was returned.

### Changing to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(data_frame, 2)) #changing the logical vector to numeric
as.numeric(pull(data_frame, 3)) #changing the character vector to numeric
as.numeric(pull(data_frame, 4)) #changing the factor vector to numeric
```

The as.numeric() function worked on the logical vector and the factor
vector. For logical vectors the function converts ‘TRUE’ to ‘1’ and
‘FALSE’ to ‘0’, respectively, which explains why the mean() function
worked. For the factor vector the as.numeric() function assigns each
factor level a number and converts the respective level to the
respective number.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #load penguins dataset
```

### Description of dataset

The penguins dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. Some of the
important variables include the species, island, bill length and depth,
flipper length, the body mass and the sex. The islands included in this
dataset are “Torgensen,” “Dream,” and “Biscoe.” The species included are
“Adelie,” “Chinstrap,” and “Gentoo.” The mean flipper length of penguins
in this dataset is 200.9152047

### Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
